# My Thought Process
- This was the hardest question I solved out of all the questions I have solved to this point (1, 9, 13, 20)
- Initally, I attempted at using enumerate in a for loop and comparing each character to a fixed variable, which would only update if all beginning characters matched it.
- However, I was unable to do it this way so I used a while loop instead.
- I would then check to see if all beginning characters from the strings matched the first character before moving onto the next, which was controlled by the i and char variable
  - i - used to change between words
  - char - used to move onto the next character from the words
- Finally, I was able to solve it after 13 attempts resulting in a large lesson learned for me
