# My Thought Process
- Initially this did quite confuse me as I've had very little experience with linked lists as a data structure
- I first needed to educate myself to understand how linked lists work and then I began to solve the problem
- My initial idea was to simply append both linked lists to one array, sort it and then reconstruct the linked list
- However, this would've led to a terrible runtime complexity and I decided I could do better
- Instead, I began by creating my own "result" linked list (by initialising the ListNode class)
- From there, I knew I had to iterate through both lists and add the correct nodes to my own list
- I achieved this by checking if the value from list1 was smaller than list 2, this meant I can add the node to my result list (current.next = list1) but can also traverse down list1
- Finally, once I had broken out of the while loop (either list1 or list2 is empty), then I would simply just add on everything left from either list1 or list2 (depending on which was empty), I knew I could do this without errors since the linked lists were already sorted
- Then from there, I just returned head.next which stores data (as I like to think of it) as a Russian doll, so simply as: result = {val : 0, next : {ListNode( val : 1, next : {...})}}
- I must admit this was a more data structure heavy question and it did take me a while; however, with amazing resources and some clever thinking I was able to accomplish it quite fast.
