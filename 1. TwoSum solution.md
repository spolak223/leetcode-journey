# My thought process:
- I saw that i had to create a target number from a list of potential integers
- Therefore, this led me to thinking: "I have to get one number and add all other numbers to it to see if it matches the target integer"
- Although it has a time complexity of O(n^2) this is the first problem I have ever solved, I do aim to improve this when I further develop my coding skills


# My solution:
