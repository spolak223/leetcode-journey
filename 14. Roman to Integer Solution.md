# My Thought Process
- This problem was a lot more challenging than the previous 2 I had attempted
- I began by creating 2 dictionaries of all valid Roman characters, which map to values. I also created a list which validates pairs that are accepted for subtraction
- Next, I started by checking for characters that were consecutive duplicates (for example III)
- Otherwise, I would check to see if the current character is smaller than the next character, then if it is valid for subtraction
- This solution took me a bit of time to figure out, however, that was the hardest part. Since all I had to do if it didn't fit the criteria, is convert it to decimal and add it to my total
