# My Thought Process
Ok so now being totally honest my solution to this was just freehand and I kind of ignored the signs of what I had to do, now that I know I needed to use binary search
I started of by thinking of the basic test cases, e.g if the number is bigger or smaller than the target
Once I ran into different problems with other test cases, I adapted my code to fit those
This pattern just repeated until I was able to provide a valid solution
However, I will be redoing this question soon once I learn the theory behind binary search and hopefully I'll get my solution to meet the appropriate criteria
